## Abstract

Many coastal towns rely on beach nourishment to mitigate erosion risks. However, rising flood risks threaten the long-term viability of this nourishment strategy. Some nourishment-dependent towns may  not be able to invest in costly sustained beach nourishments and may need to retreat. This raises the complicated question: What is the right time for a nourishment-dependent town to trigger retreat?  Here, we design and implement a framework to identify adaptive and Pareto-optimal retreat timings that account for geophysical and socioeconomic uncertainties. In our case study, retreat is crucial to robustly meet multiple objectives, including meeting regulatory benefit-cost thresholds. We demonstrate that prominent decision-making frameworks in planning and research can overlook important trade-offs and lead to myopic retreat decisions. Our framework can help planners devise more robust long-term adaptation strategies.

## Reproduce our experiment
You can follow the instructions below to reproduce all results reported in the manuscript and supplementary materials. For this experiment, reproduction does not imply bit-wise reproducibility because there are stochastic processes. You should obtain similar quantitative results and figures.
